## Organization

The book is organized into six parts. Each part starts with a chapter-level summary. We present below a brief overview of each part:

•  Part-I (four chapters): We cover the basic foundations of routing, from algorithms to protocols, along with network flow modeling.

•  Part-II (five chapters): This part is about IP network routing, from standardized protocols for both intra- and inter-domain routing, to IP traffic engineering, to Internet routing architectures.

•  Part-III (four chapters): This part covers PSTN routing, from hierarchical routing to dynamic routing, from addressing to traffic engineering, including the role of signaling in routing, along with the impact of number portability in routing.

•  Part-IV (three chapters): In this part, we cover router architectures for different scale routers for efficient packet processing, along with address lookup algorithms, and packet filtering and classification mechanisms.

•  Part-V (four chapters): As impetuses for next generation routing, we present quality-of-service routing, multiprotocol label switching, generalized multiprotocol label switching, and routing at the intersection of IP-PSTN for voice over IP.

•  Part-VI (five chapters): This bonus material (available only on the CD-ROM) is made up of two sub-parts: the first three chapters continue beyond Part-IV by delving more into routers by presenting efficient switching, packet queueing and scheduling, and traffic conditioning; the remaining two chapters extend Part-V by covering transport network routing, optical network routing, and multilayer routing.

At the beginning of each chapter, a reading guideline is provided. This gives a brief description on the background needed to read the chapter; it also discusses which other chapters this chapter is connected to or has dependency on. In general, it is **not necessary to read the chapters in the sequential order**  presented. Furthermore, the chapters are organized in a way so that the reader who has familiarity with a particular topic can move on and read other chapters of interest. Similarly, there are a few chapters on traffic engineering that require a certain level of mathematical background. They can be read independently if the reader has the background, or can be skipped for later reading, without missing the broad picture. Regardless, each chapter contains a further lookup section, which includes a brief discussion on additional reading, followed by a set of exercises that is meant for a wide audience. Notations, conventions, and symbols used in the book are summarized in Appendix A. Miscellaneous refresher topics that are helpful in understanding the material presented in this book are included in Appendix B.

In general, we have given special attention to being concise about describing each topic, while ensuring that the material is approachable for a wider set of audience. The book is still hefty in size in order to cover routing in different networks. Despite our keen interest, we needed to make the decision to leave out certain important topics instead of cutting corners on the topics presented; the topics not covered in the book (except for cursory remarks) are: multicast routing, routing in ATM networks, routing in cellular/wireless networks, routing in sensor networks, and security vulnerabilities in routing. The router command-line-based configuration of protocols is not included in this book, since there are many detailed books available on this aspect for various Internet routing protocols. Finally, there is a direct connection between routing and capacity design and planning; for an in-depth treatment of capacity design and planning, the reader is referred to the companion book [666].
