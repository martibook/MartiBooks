## Overview of Network Components

The network infrastructure contains three categories of network components

- devices
- media
- services

Devices and media are the physical elements, or hardware, of the network. 
Hardware is often the visible
such as a laptop, PC, switch, router, wireless access point, or the cabling used to connect the devices.

Services include email hosting services and web hosting services. 
Processes provide the functionality that directs and moves the messages through the network. 
are less obvious


### Devices

- Regenerate and retransmit data signals
- Maintain information about what pathways exist through the network and internetwork
- Notify other devices of errors and communication failures
- Direct data along alternate pathways where there is a link failure
- Classify and direct messages according to priorities
- Permit or deny the flow of data, based on security settings



### Media

- Metallic wires within cables

  data is encoded into electrical impulses


- Glass or plastic fibers (fiber optic cable)

  data is encoded as **pulses of light**


- Wireless transmission

  data is encoded using **wavelengths from the electromagnetic spectrum**




 Network Interface Card

 - Physical Port – end device
 
- Interface – routers



## Network Architecture


four basic characteristics that the underlying architectures need to address

- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- Security


At the foundation of all network architectures, and, in fact, at the foundation of the Internet itself, are routers and switches. Routers and switches transport data, voice, and video communications, as well as allow for wireless access, and provide for security.




## Network Security

### Security Threats

- Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses – malicious software and arbitrary code running on a user device

- Spyware and adware – software installed on a user device that secretly collects information about the user

- Zero-day attacks, also called zero-hour attacks – an attack that occurs on the first day that a vulnerability becomes known

- Hacker attacks – an attack by a knowledgeable person to user devices or network resources

- Denial of service attacks – attacks designed to slow or crash applications and processes on a network device

- Data interception and theft – an attack to capture private information from an organization’s network

- Identity theft – an attack to steal the login credentials of a user in order to access private data


### Security Solutions

- Antivirus and antispyware – These are used to protect end devices from becoming infected with malicious software.

- Firewall filtering – This is used to block unauthorized access to the network. This may include a host-based firewall system that is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the end device or a basic filtering service on the home router to prevent unauthorized access from the outside world into the network.

In addition to the above, larger networks and corporate networks often have other security requirements:

- Dedicated firewall systems – These are used to provide more advanced firewall capabilities that can filter large amounts of traffic with more granularity.

- Access control lists (ACL) – These are used to further filter access and traffic forwarding.

- Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) – These are used to identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks.

- Virtual private networks (VPN) – These are used to provide secure access to remote workers.
